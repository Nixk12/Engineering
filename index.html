            9/1/23 - This is my first journal entry!
            
            1. Write what engineering discipline you learned about this week!
            I Learned that we need to always wear your Safety Glasses when working with thigns that could break and fly.
            2. What challenge/project did you do? What have you started designing and how?
            We did a marble challenge where we had to make a marble travle down a line of pvc pipes but had to give the next person the pipe because we didnt have enough for everybody. We started working on a project where we have to start with a baseball and eventually get it to pop a balloon with a pin, we have to use pulleys ramps, levers, and etc.
            3. Write about your Challenge this week!
            We had a challenge were we had to use a website tinkercad we had to build a home appliance and who ever made the best looking object won.
