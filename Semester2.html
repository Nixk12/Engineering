         This week we learned about what is Chemical Engineering and what you do in it. Chemical Engineering is the proccess which extracts, works with and makes different type of chemicals.

         We also made oobleck by adding water slowly to corn starch, slowly mixing to make the hard/ slimy substance. When hit hard is as hard as a rock but when playd with slowly turns into almost slime and easy to break.
