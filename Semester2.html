         This week we learned about what is Chemical Engineering and what you do in it. Chemical Engineering is the proccess which extracts, works with and makes different type of chemicals.
         <br>
         We also made oobleck by adding water slowly to corn starch, slowly mixing to make the hard/ slimy substance. When hit hard is as hard as a rock but when playd with slowly turns into almost slime and easy to break.

          We are starting the proccess of making a Arduino Car, we eventually will have to build the machine from our CAD. We have already made and connected our circuit board digitally but we will have to do that same thing to make the car move. We will have to code to move the car too any way we want to.

          This next week were preparing to finalize the code and start creating the mini machine and make it drive.
          <br>
          Last week we figured out to wire and code to turn the motors on. We got it to work pretty good and now we are in the process of creating the body to hold all of the stuff.
          <br>
          By Friday I want to have atleast half of the car's body built

          Me and a few of my friends went on a private road and rode in the back of my friends truck.

          This week we worked on our Arduino Car's body, we do have a final design drawn for what it will look like when we finish building it. We have cut half of the pieces for the body of it but we still to to measure and cut the rest.
          <br>
          We can definitly fix/work on the code to get the car acutally moving and doing differnet things, we can fix our circuit board and wires.

          We tried to base our car off of a drag car. It turned out really good and looks really good, looks the best in the class, it preformed pretty good for what was programed. I messed up the code and ran out of time to fix it so it goes forward them does a burnout then turnes slightly. Overall our car was pretty good and turned out good. THe building proccess wasnt the hardest thing it wa easy most of the time.

          Right now we are starting to make a device that will protect a egg from a 3 story wiht the material we are provided with.
          <br>
          My groups approach with this project is to add differnet items to help with drag when it is dropped to slow it down. We will have straws to put the egg in the air and hold it to try to help add suspension to the egg to distort the force of the drop when it hits the ground.
          <br>
          What im scared of happining is either the items that are suppose to add drag wont work how they are intended to or the box might land werid on the floor.

          My groups egg drop when ok, the thing we made to protect it didn't really work out how we wanted it to. When it was dropped off the edge it kind of deconstructed itself on the way down. The egg fell out but some how it only had a crack in it and didn't fully break when it hit the ground. I kind of knew that what happened would happen because we had two boxes and the box with the egg in it was loose in the second box, it had to lid on it, I told myself that it might fall out of it and I was 100% right. It fully fell out of the second box but still some how the egg survived.

          Im gonna go on a 3 day crusie from Friday to Monday. Other than that im not really doing anything else over spring break, probably just gonna go out with friends once every few days.

          This week we are creating a small boat type device that has to move 500m down a gutter with either motor or blow power. Our project is just two water balloons at the bottom to keep it up and a sail because we are going to use blow power to move it but we only get 4 blows 2 from each of us.
