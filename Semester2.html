         This week we learned about what is Chemical Engineering and what you do in it. Chemical Engineering is the proccess which extracts, works with and makes different type of chemicals.
         <br>
         We also made oobleck by adding water slowly to corn starch, slowly mixing to make the hard/ slimy substance. When hit hard is as hard as a rock but when playd with slowly turns into almost slime and easy to break.

          We are starting the proccess of making a Arduino Car, we eventually will have to build the machine from our CAD. We have already made and connected our circuit board digitally but we will have to do that same thing to make the car move. We will have to code to move the car too any way we want to.

          This next week were preparing to finalize the code and start creating the mini machine and make it drive.
          <br>
          Last week we figured out to wire and code to turn the motors on. We got it to work pretty good and now we are in the process of creating the body to hold all of the stuff.
          <br>
          By Friday I want to have atleast half of the car's body built

          Me and a few of my friends went on a private road and rode in the back of my friends truck.

          This week we worked on our Arduino Car's body, we do have a final design drawn for what it will look like when we finish building it. We have cut half of the pieces for the body of it but we still to to measure and cut the rest.
          <br>
          We can definitly fix/work on the code to get the car acutally moving and doing differnet things, we can fix our circuit board and wires.
